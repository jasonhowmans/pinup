                    Take snaps with your browser
    ------------------------------------------------------------

Pinup is a Google Chrome plugin made for designer or collector types who like to keep snapshots of webpages for future refrence.

The project was started on a cold January day, when out of frustration, I wanted a better way to keep high quality images of full webpages without having to jump in and out of different applications. A Chrome plugin seemed to make sense because, being a part of the browser, it can gather information about the webpage like _title_, _description_ and so on, without getting in the way.
